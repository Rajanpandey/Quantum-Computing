# Quantum Computing

Qubit Computing with Quantum Physics using Microsoft Quantum (Q# and QDK).

It has the following 3 pillars:

## 1. Quantum Entanglement
Like waves in classical physics, any two (or more) quantum states can be added together (superposed) and the result will be another valid quantum state.

## 2. Quantum Interference
Quantum Interference is the situation where intervention from noise in the environment damages the quantum object, and also the possibility that the wave functions of particles can either reinforce (constructive) or diminish (destructive) each other.

## 3. Quantum Superposition
A physical phenomenon that occurs when a pair or group of particles is generated, interact, or share spatial proximity in a way such that the quantum state of each particle of the pair or group cannot be described independently of the state of the others, including when the particles are separated by a large distance (even the whole universe!).

# How to run

1. Install QDK for Visual Studio Code: `https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quantum.quantum-devkit-vscode`
2. Install dependencies (.NET Core 3.1 `https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download`, and Node.js `https://nodejs.org/en/download/`)
3. Go inside each folder and then inside the project (`cd`) and run `dotnet run` from the terminal
